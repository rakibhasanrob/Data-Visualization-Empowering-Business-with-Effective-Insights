# Data Visualization Empowering Business with Effective Insights

I recently completed a data analysis and visualization project for Tata Group as part of a Forage job simulation. In this project, I analyzed data from an online retail store, focusing on identifying key insights such as monthly revenue trends, top-performing products, highest-revenue regions, and customers with the most purchases.

## The project involved the following steps:

Data Cleaning: Managed over 530,000 records, removing erroneous values such as negative order quantities and unit prices.

Revenue Analysis: Created visualizations to identify monthly revenue trends for 2011, assisting in seasonal trend analysis for forecasting purposes.

Top Country and Customer Insights: Generated insights on the top 10 countries (excluding the UK) by revenue and quantity sold, as well as identifying the top 10 customers by total revenue for targeted business strategies.

Demand Analysis: Highlighted regions with the highest product demand to inform expansion strategies, offering a detailed view excluding the UK.

The project enabled the business to make data-driven decisions, ultimately supporting growth strategies through targeted insights.
